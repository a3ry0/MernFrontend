            <h2>Showcasing My Web Development Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio! I'm Audrey Do, a Computer Science student at Oregon State University, set to graduate in December 2025. My journey into technology began with a fascination for how websites worked behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to explore web development, where I discovered the joy of creating functional, visually appealing applications from scratch. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for building user-friendly web experiences and tackling complex programming challenges.</p>

            <p>My career goal is to become a software engineer, specializing in full-stack development. I want to work on innovative projects that make a difference, whether by streamlining everyday processes or bringing new ideas to life. I thrive on learning new technologies and collaborating with others to solve meaningful problems.</p>


            <h3>Technologies Behind This Website</h3>
            <p>This portfolio website demonstrates a range of tools and frameworks that I have learned and applied. It heavily utilizes the MERN stack:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: A NoSQL database for managing and querying data efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Express.js</strong>: A backend framework for creating server-side logic and APIs</li>
                <li><strong>React.js</strong>: A library for building modular and reusable UI components</li>
                <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beyond MERN, the site also incorporates additional technologies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML5</strong>: Establishing the semantic structure of the web pages</li>
                <li><strong>CSS3</strong>: Styling with modern techniques, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Enabling dynamic and interactive features</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Ensuring accessibility across various devices using media queries</li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming</strong>: Managing non-blocking operations such as API calls and timers to improve performance</li>
                <li><strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>: Manipulating and updating the structure and content of the webpage dynamically</li>
                <li><strong>SPA (Single Page Application)</strong>: Building a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the content without reloading the page</li>
                <li><strong>Mongoose</strong>: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB to simplify data interactions and validations</li>
                <li><strong>REST</strong>: Designing and implementing APIs using RESTful principles for efficient client-server communication</li>
                <li><strong>CRUD</strong>: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data effectively</li>
            </ul>
